We gathered at our regular meetings, but there was just something missing… We were newly assembled and we had to create some sort of a bond, so we’d stick together through good and bad times. So we decided to go on a  weekend working trip to the seaside. We worked for 3 whole days, brainstormed, drew on flipcharts, and made SWOT analyses about what we could offer companies so that they would support us. We even thought about combining our local JobFair and Congress into one event, which would tell the story of EESTEC. </p>

We needed some time off so we decided to play Slovenian 4 player card game (tarock) which really bonds a group of players. We ate all the time and there were coffee and tea running through our veins pumping the blood to our brains. We had a barbeque, drank beer, went to the beach, danced a little bit, listened to music on LC Ljubljana block rocker...</p>

                        <p style="margin-top:0">We started with the partnership campaign in October when we prepared cooperation packages  that we could offer companies (company promotion, case-studies, presentations...) and a list of companies we wanted to participate with. Our designer then designed the offer and we sent it to the companies in November. Several companies replied and we set meetings, where we presented the Spring Congress and possibilities of cooperation. Based on the meeting, companies decided to invest in the Spring Congress.

You start describing how awesome EESTEC is,  talking about all the opportunities they will have with such an event as the Congress. The best moment is when they are really satisfied with the work we do and they say: "We are interested in sponsoring your event."

The desire for new knowledge and challenges is after all not enough for a freshman to apply for the organisation of such an enormous event. The core team's approach was the reason I applied. I thought I had to have plenty of prior knowledge in order to apply, but that was not the case. All new members of the team are new LC members and the initiation is very friendly. I think having new members in the team is a relief for the older, more experienced members. We take on tasks that do not present any challenge at all for them, while we learn a lot.</p>

Since our congress leader is currently studying in Novi Sad, we gather every Wednesday at 5pm at our premises in Ljubljana and make a videoconference call with others who are online. Nevertheless, sometimes internet connection problems occur and therefore some topics have to be discussed two times, three times, four times… :D

A few e-mails and a lot more direct communication via Slack, which we use like a casual FB messenger chat. The chairwoman, Maria Kouneli, is handling most of the comm with us. Till now we had only 7 online meetings, maybe 120 emails exchanged and definitely more than 1500 direct messages via Slack (with meaningful content, not chit-chat ;) ). Oh, and Slack introduced threads in January, what was a great boost in messages for us!

                        <p style="margin-top:0">The first task I was given after joining the Spring Congress Organizing Committee was to take care of accommodation for Alumni Congress and Unofficial participants. It started off by exchanging a lot of emails and creating probably the longest email thread in my inbox (over 70 messages and growing). We narrowed our selection down to three hostels and arranged meetings with them. After the meeting in Hostel Tresor, Leon and I knew this where the unofficial participants were going to stay, since it was better than others in most aspects. I reserved this hostel and another one for Alumni Congress.

                        <p style="margin-top:0">I thought everything was arranged when one day an email came in that turned everything upside down. I had to reread it to make sure it was really happening. The hostel that was supposed to host Alumni participants cancelled our reservation. I had to urgently send more inquiries and luckily the first offer worked for us. After the deposit was paid for both hostels the weight was lifted off my shoulders and I was ready for new tasks.

                        <p style="margin-top:0">Kranjska Gora is an important Slovene tourist destination and has apparently been the prime destination for EESTEC LC Ljubljana, when it comes to the unofficial part of events. Being a new EESTEC member, I have not experienced what the town has to offer, however I expect it to be very enjoyable, as the senior members have highly praised it. The trip to Kranjska Gora takes about a good hour. Most of the people will be staying in apartments Nina and Tina, and a small portion will be accommodated in Gozd Martuljek. The rooms all looked great and I think that everyone will enjoy them.
